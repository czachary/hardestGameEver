# hardestGameEver

This version of the game differs from the traditional Hardest Game Ever as there is only 1 level, and the player has 3 lives.

PURPOSE: You are the red square. Avoid the blue squares and make it to the finish line before you run out of lives!

INSTRUCTIONS: You can move up, down, left, or right through the three sets of enemies.
	</br>Any contact with the blue squares will cause you to lose a life and be sent back to the beginning of the level.
	</br>Pressing SELECT at any time will send you back to the title screen and reset your lives.
	</br>Once you arrive at either the "game over" or "you win" screen, you can press SELECT to go back to the title screen.
	</br>There is a "Lives" indicator in the upper right during game play, this text will turn to red when you have one life left.
	
EMULATOR: Under the Tools directory, you can find emulator tools to run the game. Download both the 2110-tools and 2110-tools-emulator for either Linux 32 bit or 64 bit.
